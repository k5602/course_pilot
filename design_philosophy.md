Design Philosophy & Implementation Strategy for Course Pilot
Core Philosophy: The "Calm-Tech Learning Cockpit"

This document outlines the design and implementation strategy for the Course Pilot user interface. The guiding philosophy is to create a "Calm-Tech Learning Cockpit". This principle asserts that technology should be a quiet, helpful partner, not a demanding distraction. The application should empower users by making complex tasks feel simple, intuitive, and focused.

This means the UI should be:

    Quiet & Focused: Visually clean and uncluttered, minimizing distractions and allowing the user's content to be the hero. This is achieved through a minimalist aesthetic, a restrained color palette, and a strong visual hierarchy. The goal is to reduce cognitive load, so the user can enter a state of deep focus on their learning material without the UI competing for their attention.

    Intelligent & Contextual: The UI should anticipate user needs, showing relevant information and actions only when they are needed. Complexity is hidden until required. For instance, instead of displaying all possible actions on a course card at all times, primary actions appear clearly while secondary options (like "Delete" or "Export") are neatly tucked into a context menu, revealed by a click. This makes the interface feel smarter and less overwhelming.

    Futuristic & Elegant: The aesthetic should feel modern, responsive, and tactile, using subtle motion and clean typography to create a premium experience. This isn't about flashy, unnecessary animations, but about providing meaningful feedback. A button should feel like it's being pressed, a new item should gracefully enter the screen, and the entire application should feel alive and responsive to the user's touch.

Platform Strategy: Desktop-First, Cross-Platform Future

Objective: Build a robust native desktop application initially, while architecting for seamless expansion to web and mobile platforms in the future.

Implementation Details:

    Current Focus (Desktop): The primary target is a native desktop application for Windows and Linux. This leverages the dioxus-desktop renderer for maximum performance, direct file system access for local courses, and deep OS integration possibilities like native notifications or keyboard shortcuts.

    Future Expansion (Web & Mobile): The architecture must be platform-agnostic to ensure long-term viability.

        Web App: The component-based design is ideal for compiling to WebAssembly (WASM), enabling a full-featured web application with minimal code changes. This will allow users to access their study plans from any browser.

        Mobile App (Android): Dioxus's support for mobile platforms makes an Android version a clear and achievable goal on the roadmap, perfect for learning on the go.

    Architectural Implication: A strict separation between the UI (ui module) and the core backend logic (state, database, ingest, nlp, planner) is mandatory. The core logic must be pure, portable Rust, avoiding direct dependencies on desktop-only APIs. For example, instead of using a function that directly writes a file in a way that only works on desktop, we would define a trait for "storage" that can be implemented differently for desktop (writing to a file) and web (using browser localStorage or a server). This ensures the core engine can be reused across all future platforms without a major rewrite.

This strategy will be executed in three distinct phases, leveraging the dioxus-daisyui component library and the broader Dioxus ecosystem.
Phase 1: The Foundation - Global Design System

This phase establishes the global rules, themes, and layouts that will govern the entire application, ensuring a consistent and polished feel.
1.1. Theming System

Objective: Implement a robust, beautiful, and instantly switchable light/dark mode.

Tooling: dioxus-daisyui

Implementation Details:

    Light Mode Theme: Utilize the lofi theme from DaisyUI. This theme evokes the feeling of a clean, organized workspace. Its high-contrast, black-and-white nature with sharp corners minimizes visual noise, making it perfect for long reading and study sessions.

    Dark Mode Theme: Utilize the night theme from DaisyUI. This theme creates an immersive, focused environment. The deep navy base with carefully chosen blue and purple accents provides a futuristic, "synthwave" feel that is both aesthetically pleasing and easy on the eyes in low-light conditions.

    Mechanism: The root App component will manage a shared state that controls the data-theme attribute on the main HTML element. This will allow for seamless theme switching that instantly propagates through all DaisyUI components, ensuring a consistent and predictable look.

1.2. Application Layout

Objective: Create a modern, responsive, multi-panel layout that intelligently adapts to different screen sizes and workflows.

Implementation Details:

    Structure: A three-panel responsive design.

        Navigation Sidebar (Left): A slim, icon-only sidebar for top-level navigation (e.g., Dashboard, All Courses, Settings). Use icons from dioxus-free-icons. On desktop, it will expand on hover to reveal text labels, providing clarity without taking up permanent screen real estate. On smaller screens or tablet-like windows, it will gracefully collapse into a hamburger menu to maximize content visibility.

        Main Content Area (Center): This is the primary workspace. It will house the Course Dashboard grid, the detailed Plan View, and settings pages. Its layout will be fluid, allowing content to reflow naturally.

        Contextual Panel (Right): A panel that is hidden by default and slides in from the right when needed. Its primary use case is for the "Aha!" Notes editor, keeping notes visible alongside the video player or checklist, creating a powerful, integrated learning environment.

    Styling: The sidebar will use a "glassmorphism" effect (a semi-transparent, blurred background). This creates a subtle sense of depth and visual hierarchy, making the main content area feel like the primary layer of focus.

1.3. Motion & Interactivity

Objective: Breathe life into the application with purposeful, non-jarring animations.

Tooling: dioxus-motion

Implementation Details:

    Presence Animations: All major components and list items will gently fade-in and slide-up as they appear on screen using the <Animate> component. This prevents jarring content shifts and makes the application feel smooth and responsive.

    Layout Animations: When items are added or removed from a list (e.g., a new course on the dashboard), the grid will gracefully animate the re-flow using <AnimateLayout>. This avoids disorienting jumps and helps the user maintain their mental model of the interface.

    Hover & Focus Effects: Interactive elements like cards and buttons will have subtle "lift" and "scale" transitions on hover, implemented with the <Motion> component. This provides tactile feedback, acknowledging the user's interaction and making the UI feel more tangible and engaging.

Phase 2: Core Component Implementation

This phase focuses on building the key screens and components that form the core user experience.
2.1. The Dashboard Screen

Objective: Create an inspiring and informative launchpad for the user's learning journey.

Implementation Details:

    Layout: A responsive grid of CourseCard components that feels like a personal library of knowledge and achievements.

    Header: A clean header containing the application title, a global search bar (for a future phase), and a prominent primary Button for "Add New Course," making the most common action immediately accessible.

2.2. The CourseCard Component

Objective: Design a visually rich and data-dense card that represents a single course.

Tooling: dioxus-daisyui::Card, dioxus-daisyui::Progress, dioxus-motion

Implementation Details:

    Structure: Use the Card component from DaisyUI as a flexible base.

    Visuals: The card should have a subtle hover effect (lift and glow) managed by dioxus-motion. This effect invites interaction and signals that the card is a clickable, active element.

    Content:

        CardBody: Contains the h2 course title and a p subtitle with metadata (e.g., "12 videos â€¢ 4.5 hours").

        Progress: A slim progress bar from DaisyUI, colored with Color::Accent, will visually represent the course completion, offering an at-a-glance status update.

        CardActions: Buttons for primary actions like "Continue Learning" will be right-aligned at the bottom. A three-dot menu icon will trigger a Dropdown for secondary actions like "Export" or "Delete", keeping the card clean.

2.3. The Course View Screen

Objective: Design the main learning interface, combining the checklist, player, and notes.

Implementation Details:

    Layout: A two-column layout designed for an efficient learning workflow.

        Left Column (Checklist): A scrollable list of modules and sections. Use the Collapse (accordion) component from DaisyUI for modules to keep the view organized. Each video item will have a Checkbox. On check, the item's background will animate to a new color, and the text will receive a strikethrough, providing clear and satisfying visual feedback.

        Right Column (Contextual Panel): This panel will use Tabs to switch between a "Player" view (containing the embedded video) and a "Notes" view (containing the rich text editor). Clicking a new video in the checklist can automatically switch the focus in this panel, creating a seamless connection between the plan and the content.

    Feedback: Use dioxus-toast for non-intrusive notifications. When a plan is saved or a course is imported, a sleek toast will slide in from a screen corner, confirming the action was successful without interrupting the user's flow.

Phase 3: The Futuristic Polish & UX Enhancements

This phase adds the final layer of polish that elevates the application from functional to delightful.
3.1. Command Palette

Objective: Implement a fast, keyboard-driven interface for power users.

Implementation Details:

    A central Modal component, triggered by a keyboard shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+K). This feature is a hallmark of modern productivity tools, empowering users to operate the app at the speed of thought.

    It will contain a single Input field that searches and filters a list of actions (e.g., "Go to course: Advanced Rust," "Add New Course," "Toggle Theme"). This provides an incredibly fast way to navigate and operate the app, making users feel proficient and in control.

3.2. Advanced Visual Effects

Objective: Use subtle visual effects to reinforce the futuristic aesthetic.

Implementation Details:

    Glassmorphism: Apply this effect to the main navigation sidebar and any modal dialogs. This is more than just transparency; it's a calculated use of blur and subtle borders to create a visual hierarchy that guides the eye and makes the UI feel layered and sophisticated.

    Glow Effects: Primary action buttons and active elements (like a selected navigation item) will have a soft box-shadow using the theme's accent color. This creates a subtle "glow" that draws the user's eye, provides clear affordance for interactive elements, and enhances the futuristic feel, especially in dark mode.

3.3. Data-Rich, Minimal UI Principle

Objective: Keep the UI clean by showing complexity only when necessary.

Implementation Details:

    Use Context Menus: Instead of cluttering cards and list items with many buttons, hide secondary actions inside Dropdown or right-click context menus. This declutters the interface while keeping all functionality easily accessible.

    Visualize Data: This principle resolves the paradox of being both "data-rich" and "minimal." We will replace raw numbers with elegant visualizations wherever possible. For instance, instead of text saying "Daily Goal: 2/5 videos," we can show a RadialProgress ring that fills up, providing a much more engaging and immediate understanding of progress.
