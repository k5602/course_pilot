- Extensible Data Model:
  - Notes, courses, and planner are designed for easy extension (tags, attachments, analytics, etc.).

- Migration-Ready:
  - Schema migrations and upgrade paths are documented and tested.

- Async-Ready:
  - Backend can be migrated to async for high-concurrency or cloud scenarios.

- API-Driven:
  - All UI/backend interaction is via clear, documented APIs, supporting future REST/gRPC/websocket layers.

## Phase 3 Completion: Lessons Learned & Architectural Decisions

### Key Technical Decisions Made

1. **Async Pattern Architecture**
   - Used `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` for all database operations to avoid blocking the async runtime
   - Implemented proper Dioxus async patterns with `use_resource` for data loading and `spawn()` for mutations
   - Replaced all blocking calls (`futures::executor::block_on`) with proper async/await patterns

2. **Progress Tracking Implementation**
   - Used composite identifiers (plan_id + item_index) for plan items instead of adding ID fields to maintain data model integrity
   - Implemented optimistic UI updates with error rollback for better user experience
   - Created PlanExt trait for enhanced plan operations while keeping core types clean

3. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Implemented Phase3Error enum for structured, user-friendly error messages
   - Created comprehensive error handling utilities that provide actionable guidance
   - Integrated toast notifications for all async operations with proper error recovery

4. **Enhanced Ingest System**
   - Used `walkdir` crate for efficient recursive directory traversal
   - Implemented async processing with progress callbacks and cancellation support
   - Added comprehensive video file extension support and batch processing for large collections

5. **Testing Architecture**
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for all backend adapter methods
   - Implemented integration tests for complete user workflows
   - Added performance tests for concurrent operations and large datasets
   - Used temporary databases and directories for isolated test environments

### Performance Optimizations

- **Database Operations**: Connection pooling with r2d2 for efficient database access
- **Directory Scanning**: Two-pass scanning (count first, then process) for accurate progress reporting
- **Batch Processing**: Configurable batch sizes for large directory collections
- **Memory Management**: Streaming results to avoid memory issues with large datasets
- **Concurrent Operations**: Proper async patterns that support concurrent database operations

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Type Safety**: Enhanced type system with proper error types and structured identifiers
- **Modularity**: Clean separation between UI, backend adapter, and storage layers
- **Testability**: Comprehensive test coverage with unit, integration, and performance tests
- **Documentation**: Inline documentation for all public APIs and complex operations
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages and recovery options

### Future-Proofing Decisions

- **Async-Ready**: All backend operations are structured for easy migration to fully async database operations
- **Extensible**: Backend adapter pattern supports easy addition of new operations
- **Scalable**: Progress tracking system can handle large plans with thousands of items
- **Cancellable**: Long-running operations support cancellation for better user experience
- **Observable**: Comprehensive logging and error reporting for debugging and monitoring
