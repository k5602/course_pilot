# Course Pilot: The Learning Sanctuary

## Vision

Course Pilot is an anti-distraction, local-first environment for deep learning. It transforms chaotic video playlists into finite, structured courses designed for completion, not consumption.

## Core Pillars

### 1. Distraction-Free by Default

YouTube is engineered to keep you watching; Course Pilot is engineered to help you finish.

- **No Recommendations**: The algorithm ends at the "Import" button.
- **No Comments/Noise**: A sterile lab environment for your mind.
- **Zero-Clutter UI**: The video and your progress are the only priorities.

### 2. Structure from Chaos

Raw playlists are often overwhelming. Course Pilot imposes order without breaking the creator's intent.

- **Order Preservation**: The original playlist sequence is sacred and never reordered.
- **Cognitive Pacing**: Local Machine Learning (embeddings) groups videos into logical modules to manage cognitive load.
- **Suggested Sessions**: The system calculates session boundaries to prevent burnout and ensure a finite, manageable roadmap.

### 3. Explicit and Meaningful Progress

"You always know what's done and what isn't."

- **Binary Contract**: Progress is tracked explicitly. A lesson is either mastered or pending.
- **Stateful Environment**: A permanent, local library where your learning history is preserved, not forgotten in a browser tab.

### 4. The Human-AI Partnership

We use AI (Gemini) not to replace the student, but to challenge them.

- **The Companion**: A sidecar assistant that understands the current context to answer deep questions during playback.
- **The Examiner**: Moving beyond passive watching. The AI acts as a validator, generating structured exams upon user request to verify retention.

## The Completion Mindset

In a world of infinite content, the most valuable tool is the one that helps you stop consuming and start completing. Course Pilot is that tool.
