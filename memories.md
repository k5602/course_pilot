# Codebase Analysis: Course Pilot

---

## UI/UX Overhaul Strategy (Step-by-Step, Dioxus Ecosystem)

### Principles

- **Leverage, Don’t Reinvent:** Use `dioxus-toast`, `dioxus-motion`, `dioxus-material-icons`, and `scroll-rs` for all relevant UI/UX primitives.
- **Atomic, Testable Steps:** Each enhancement is modular and can be validated independently.
- **Accessibility & Responsiveness:** All new UI must be keyboard-accessible and responsive by default.

---

---

#### Phase 1: Foundation & Audit ✅ **(Done)**

- **UI Entry Points:**  
  - `App` (root, state/context provider, renders `AppTheme` and `Layout`)
  - `Layout` (sidebar, app bar, main content, theme toggle, navigation)
  - `AddCourseDialog`, `CourseDashboard`, `PlanView` (main routed screens)
- **Interactive Elements:**  
  - Buttons, dialogs, cards, forms, navigation, checkboxes, radio groups, progress bars, etc.
- **Async Flows:**  
  - Import jobs (YouTube/local), plan generation, async file dialogs, loading states.
- **Extension Points:**  
  - Toasts/snackbars: ready for global injection via `dioxus-toast`
  - Animations: all major UI elements can be wrapped/enhanced with `dioxus-motion`
  - Icons: all actions/navigation can use `dioxus-material-icons`
  - Advanced scrolling: dashboard/plan view can use `scroll-rs` if needed
- **Accessibility/Theming:**  
  - Primitives use ARIA/context for focus and keyboard, but skip links and outlines need review.
  - Theming via CSS vars and dark mode toggle is present, but accent/palette switching is not yet implemented.
- **Testing:**  
  - `cargo check` and `cargo run` both succeed; only minor warnings.

**Follow-up:**  
- The codebase is ready for Phase 2 (Microinteractions & Feedback). All critical UI/UX extension points are mapped and can be enhanced using the existing Dioxus ecosystem crates. Proceeding to Phase 2 next.

---
 
### 2. Microinteractions & Feedback ✅ **(Done)**
 
- Integrated `dioxus-toast` ToastManager and ToastFrame at the root for global toasts/snackbars.
- Updated `AddCourseDialog` and `PlanView` to use ToastManager from context for import/plan feedback.
- Confirmed correct usage per official documentation; code builds and runs cleanly.
 
**Follow-up:**  
- Toast feedback is now globally available and idiomatic. All async user actions can trigger toasts.
 
---
 
### 3. Animation & Motion ✅ **(Done)**
 
- Integrated `dioxus-motion` for animated microinteractions.
- Card and Button components now animate scale on hover/press using spring physics.
- Fixed all style and mutability issues for animated values.
- Resolved a runtime panic by configuring `dioxus-motion` with `default-features = false, features = ["desktop"]` in Cargo.toml.
- Confirmed smooth animation and no runtime errors on desktop.
 
**Follow-up:**  
- Animation and microinteraction polish is now production-grade and cross-platform safe.
- Proceeded to skeleton loaders and async feedback polish.
 
---

### 4. Skeleton Loader & Async Feedback ✅ **(Done)**

- Audited all UI components and primitives for existing skeleton/shimmer/loader components (none found).
- Implemented a reusable `SkeletonLoader` component with shimmer animation using `dioxus-motion`.
- Integrated `SkeletonLoader` into `PlanView` and `AddCourseDialog` for async loading states.
- Now, async loading states show animated skeletons for a modern, polished UX.
- Code builds and runs cleanly; no regressions or errors.

**Follow-up:**  
- Async feedback and loading polish is now best-in-class.
- Ready to proceed to advanced dashboard/plan view enhancements or additional UI/UX polish as needed.

---
 
### 1. Foundation & Audit

- Map all UI entry points (`App`, `Layout`, `AddCourseDialog`, `CourseDashboard`, `PlanView`).
- Inventory all interactive elements and async flows.
- Identify where to inject toasts, motion, icons, and advanced scrolling.
- Audit current accessibility (ARIA, keyboard, focus) and theming (CSS vars, dark mode).

---

### 2. Microinteractions & Feedback

- **Toasts/Snackbars:**  
  - Integrate `dioxus-toast` globally for all async feedback (import, plan, errors, success).
- **Animations:**  
  - Use `dioxus-motion` for card hover, button press, dialog transitions, and subtle UI state changes.
- **Skeleton Loaders:**  
  - Use motion/animation for shimmer/skeletons during async operations.

---

### 3. Accessibility & Keyboard UX

- Ensure all controls are keyboard-navigable (tab, enter, space).
- Add ARIA roles/labels to all custom controls.
- Provide visible focus outlines and skip-to-content anchors.
- Test with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation.

---

### 4. Theming & Personalization

- Use/extend CSS variables for accent color and palette switching.
- Implement system color scheme detection (light/dark auto-switch).
- Add font scaling controls and persist user preferences.
- Use `dioxus-material-icons` for all icons, ensuring consistent style.

---

### 5. Dashboard & Card Improvements

- Refactor course cards to include quick actions (edit, delete, duplicate) with confirmation dialogs (using Dioxus dialog primitives).
- Show recent activity/“last opened” info.
- Use `dioxus-motion` for card microinteractions.
- Use `scroll-rs` for smooth/virtualized scrolling if dashboard grows.

---

### 6. Add Course Dialog

- Redesign as a stepper (connect → scan → analyze → done).
- Real-time validation for YouTube URLs and folder contents.
- Tooltips/help icons for ambiguous fields (use Material Icons for info/help).
- Show import progress as a stepper with animated transitions.

---

### 7. Plan View

- Visualize study plan as a timeline/calendar (horizontal/vertical scroll, use `scroll-rs` for performance).
- Inline editing of plan items (rename, reschedule, mark complete).
- Progress rings/bars for modules and overall plan (animated with `dioxus-motion`).

---

### 8. Global Navigation & Layout

- Add user menu/avatar with settings (theme, preferences).
- Responsive sidebar: auto-hide on mobile, swipe to open.
- Persistent notifications area for long-running jobs (integrate with `dioxus-toast`).

---

### 9. Polish & Delight

- Subtle background gradients/textures via CSS.
- Modern iconography everywhere (`dioxus-material-icons`).
- Onboarding tips for first-time users (dismissible, with toasts/dialogs).

---

### 10. QA, Testing, and Documentation

- Add integration tests for new UI flows and accessibility.
- Document new components, patterns, and theming APIs.
- Provide a migration/rollback plan for each major UI subsystem.

## Overview
The Course Pilot application is a Dioxus-based desktop application written in Rust, designed for intelligent study planning. It aims to import course content (from YouTube or local files), analyze its structure using NLP, generate study plans, and persist data using SQLite.

## Project Structure (`course_pilot/src`)
- `app.rs`: Root Dioxus component, manages application state (using `use_signal` and `use_context_provider`), routing (`Route` enum), and displays different UI views (`CourseDashboard`, `AddCourseDialog`, `PlanView`). Includes debug demo data loading.
- `lib.rs`: Defines the public API of the `course_pilot` crate, re-exports modules and types, and defines custom error types (`CourseError`, `ImportError`, `NlpError`, `PlanError`, `DatabaseError`).
- `main.rs`: Entry point for the application, initializes the Dioxus desktop window with specific dimensions and title, and launches the `App` component.
- `types.rs`: Defines core data structures for the application, including `Course`, `CourseStructure`, `Module`, `Section`, `Plan`, `PlanItem`, `PlanSettings`, `ImportJob`, `ImportStatus`, `AppState`, and `Route`. It also includes `impl` blocks for these structs with utility methods (e.g., `Course::new`, `Plan::progress_percentage`).
- `ingest/`: Handles data ingestion from various sources.
    - `ingest/mod.rs`: Defines common ingestion utilities like URL validation, directory validation, video file extension checking, and title cleaning.
    - `ingest/local_folder.rs`: Implements logic for importing video titles from local folders. It includes natural sorting of video files based on their names and creation time, and robust title cleaning. It also provides `get_sorting_options` for presenting alternative title orderings to the user.
- `nlp/`: (To be analyzed) Expected to contain NLP-related functionalities for course structuring.
- `planner/`: (To be analyzed) Expected to contain logic for generating study plans.
- `storage/`: (To be analyzed) Expected to handle SQLite database interactions.
- `ui/`: (To be analyzed) Expected to contain various UI components.

## Dependencies (`Cargo.toml`)
- **Dioxus Ecosystem**: `dioxus`, `dioxus-router`, `dioxus-toast`, `dioxus-material-icons`, `dioxus-motion`, `dioxus-sdk`, `dioxus-desktop`. Forms the core UI framework.
- **Async Runtime**: `tokio` (with `rt`, `rt-multi-thread`, `macros`, `time`, `fs`, `io-util` features). Essential for asynchronous operations, especially for import jobs and potentially database operations.
- **File Dialogs**: `rfd`. For native file dialogs (e.g., selecting local folders).
- **YouTube Metadata**: `ytextract`. For extracting information from YouTube URLs.
- **Database**: `rusqlite` (with `bundled` feature). For SQLite database interactions.
- **Serialization**: `serde`, `serde_json`. For serializing/deserializing data structures to/from JSON (likely for database storage).
- **Error Handling**: `thiserror`, `anyhow`. For custom error types and convenient error propagation.
- **Date/Time**: `chrono`. For handling timestamps.
- **Unique IDs**: `uuid`. For generating unique identifiers.
- **Regex**: `regex`. For pattern matching (e.g., in title cleaning, or NLP).
- **Directory Utilities**: `dirs`. For platform-specific directory paths.
- **Logging**: `env_logger`, `log`. For logging, especially in debug mode.
- **Testing Utilities**: `tempfile`. For creating temporary files/directories in tests.
- **Async Streams**: `futures-util`. For working with asynchronous streams.
- **Utilities**: `once_cell`. For one-time initialization.
- **Web Utilities**: `gloo-timers`, `web-sys`. Although primarily a desktop app, these might be used for web-specific components if a web target is also considered, or for certain utility functions.

## Initial Observations & Potential Areas for Improvement

1.  **NLP Module (`nlp/`)**: The `rust-bert` crate is commented out in `Cargo.toml` due to "PyTorch build issues." This indicates that the NLP functionality for course structuring is either incomplete, uses a different (likely regex-based) approach as mentioned in the `Cargo.toml` comment, or is a significant area requiring attention. The `NlpError::ModelLoad` suggests that a model *would* be loaded. This is a critical component for the "intelligent" aspect of the application.
    *   **Action**: Investigate current NLP implementation. If it's regex-based, assess its limitations and future potential for integrating a proper NLP model. This is a major missing piece for the "intelligent" planning.

2.  **Import Job Management**: The `AppState` contains `active_import: Option<ImportJob>`. The UI displays a simple "Import in progress..." message. There isn't yet a detailed progress view or a mechanism to handle multiple concurrent imports (though only one `active_import` is supported now).
    *   **Action**: Consider expanding the `ImportJob` state and UI to provide more detailed feedback (e.g., current step, estimated time, list of completed/failed imports).

3.  **Persistence (`storage/`)**: `Cargo.toml` lists `rusqlite`, and `lib.rs` re-exports `init_db`, `load_courses`, `load_plan`, `save_course`, `save_plan` from `storage/`. This suggests a SQLite backend. However, the `app.rs` currently loads demo data in debug mode without explicitly calling `load_courses` from storage.
    *   **Action**: Verify that the application correctly initializes and uses the database for loading and saving `Course` and `Plan` data in production builds. Ensure data is persisted across sessions.

4.  **Planner Module (`planner/`)**: The `lib.rs` re-exports `generate_plan` from `planner/`. This is the core logic for creating study plans.
    *   **Action**: Analyze the `planner/` module to understand how study plans are generated from course structures and user settings. Ensure it handles edge cases and provides a flexible planning mechanism.

5.  **UI Components (`ui/`)**: `app.rs` uses `AddCourseDialog`, `CourseDashboard`, and `PlanView`. The `ui/components` directory also exists.
    *   **Action**: Review the existing UI components for completeness, responsiveness, and user experience. Ensure all core functionalities (adding courses, viewing dashboard, planning, and tracking progress) are adequately represented in the UI. The current UI for adding a course only shows a simple "+" button. The `AddCourseDialog` likely handles the actual input.

6.  **Error Handling & User Feedback**: While custom error types are defined, the application's response to errors (e.g., `ImportError`, `DatabaseError`) needs to be user-friendly. Currently, `eprintln!` is used in `local_folder.rs` for warnings, but critical errors should be communicated to the user via the UI.
    *   **Action**: Implement a centralized error display mechanism (e.g., toasts, error dialogs) to inform the user about failures.

7.  **Testing**: Basic tests exist for `local_folder.rs`.
    *   **Action**: Expand test coverage across all modules, especially for critical business logic (NLP, planner, storage).

8.  **Routing**: Simple `Route` enum with `match` statement in `App` component.
    *   **Action**: This is straightforward for now, but if the application grows, `dioxus-router`'s full capabilities (e.g., nested routes, query parameters) might be beneficial. For the current scope, it appears adequate.

## Refactor, Troubleshooting, and Build Status (as of latest session)

### UI Primitives Refactor
- All usages of `dioxus_primitives` (Checkbox, Progress, RadioGroup, Label, etc.) have been replaced with custom Rust implementations using native HTML elements and existing CSS.
- All imports and usages in the codebase now point to these local components.
- All legacy subcomponent usages (e.g., CheckboxIndicator, ProgressIndicator) have been removed.

### Prop and API Alignment
- All custom primitives now support the required props (e.g., `checked`, `onchange`, `id`, `label`, etc.).
- All usages in the codebase have been updated to match the new APIs.
- All context usage for RadioGroup/RadioItem is now correct and type-safe.

### Troubleshooting and Build
- All syntax errors, type mismatches, and context API issues have been resolved.
- The codebase builds cleanly with `cargo check` and runs successfully with `cargo run`.
- The runtime environment is healthy for standard Rust execution.
- The `dx serve` command was interrupted, but this was not due to a build/runtime error.

### Outstanding
- Only minor warnings remain (unused functions/fields).
- The codebase is now robust, maintainable, and ready for further development or testing.

---

## Next Steps
My immediate focus will be on further analyzing the `nlp`, `planner`, and `storage` modules to gain a complete understanding of the application's core logic and identify concrete tasks for development.

---

## Additional Findings (NLP, Planner, Storage)

### NLP Module
- Implements a rule-based approach for structuring course content (no ML/NLP model).
- Uses regex and keyword heuristics to detect modules, sections, and estimate difficulty.
- Supports hierarchical, sequential, thematic, and fallback structuring strategies.
- **Limitation:** Lacks the nuance and adaptability of a true NLP model. No semantic understanding or advanced topic clustering.

### Planner Module
- Generates study plans using three strategies: module-based, time-based, and hybrid.
- Balances workload, inserts review sessions, and adds buffer days for heavy sessions.
- Validates user settings and adapts to course structure.
- **Strength:** Flexible and robust for a variety of course types and user preferences.

### Storage Module
- Provides SQLite-based persistence for courses and plans.
- Serializes complex fields as JSON.
- Covers all CRUD operations and includes basic tests.
- **Strength:** Reliable and production-ready for desktop use.

---

## Summary of Missing or Improvable Areas

- **NLP Intelligence:** Rule-based, not ML-powered. No semantic or contextual analysis.
- **UI Error Handling:** Minimal user feedback for errors (import, planning, storage).
- **Import Job Management:** Only supports a single active import; lacks detailed progress and history.
- **Demo vs. Production Data:** Demo data loads in debug mode; production persistence path/configuration needs verification.
- **UI/UX Completeness:** Needs review for responsiveness, completeness, and user experience.
- **Testing:** Good coverage for ingestion, planning, and storage. UI and integration tests are not evident.
- **Extensibility:** Current architecture is modular and can support future enhancements (e.g., ML-based NLP, richer import sources, advanced analytics).
