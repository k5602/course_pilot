# Course Pilot Implementation Checklist (Current Status)

A scalable, modular, and future-proof roadmap for Dioxus Desktop UI & Backend Integration


## Dioxus UI Crates & Dependencies

### Core UI

- dioxus-daisyui v0.8.0+: For all core UI components, theming, and layout patterns
- daisyui v5.0.46+: For Tailwind CSS v4 plugin system and component styles
- @tailwindcss/cli v4.1.11+: For processing Tailwind CSS with plugin support

### Styling & Theming

- Tailwind CSS v4+: For utility-first responsive design
- Autoprefixer: For cross-browser compatibility

### Icons & Interactions

- dioxus-free-icons: For Material Design iconography
- dioxus-motion: For animations and transitions
- dioxus-toast: For user notifications and feedback

### State Management

- dioxus-sdk: For application state and hooks
- context7-mcp: understnding Documentation

### Build & Tooling

- Node.js v22.16.0+: Required for Tailwind CSS v4
- npm v10.9.2+: For dependency management


## Phase 1: Global Foundation & Theming

- [x] Scaffold Three-Panel Layout
  - [x] Use dioxus-daisyui for layout primitives and panel structure.
  - [x] Sidebar with dioxus-free-icons for navigation
  - [x] Main Content (dashboard, plan view, settings)
  - [x] Contextual Panel with tabs for switching
  - [x] Responsive design with dioxus-tailwindcss
  - [x] Fixed sidebar overlap issue in `layout.rs`
  - [x] Implemented proper theme toggle functionality

- [x] Implement Global Theming
  - [x] DaisyUI lofi (light) and night (dark) themes
  - [x] Theme toggle in App shell with context/signal
  - [x] Theme persistence in desktop-native config
  - [x] Fixed theme toggle functionality in `theme_unified.rs`
  - No JS interop is used for theme switching in desktop mode; all logic is Rust-native and future-proofed for web.
  - Scalability: Context-driven theme system, supporting future custom themes or branding.

- [x] Establish AppState Signal/Context
  - Use dioxus-sdk for global, reactive state for all UI.
  - Scalability: Centralized state enables easy extension for new features and cross-component communication.


## Phase 2: Core Component Structure

- [ ] Create Modular File Structure
  - ui/layout.rs: App shell, theming, sidebar, main, contextual panel
  - ui/components/: DaisyUI-based reusable components (Card, Button, Progress, Modal, Toast, Dropdown, Tabs, Accordion, etc.) using dioxus-daisyui.
  - ui/dashboard.rs: Dashboard grid and CourseCard
  - ui/plan_view.rs: Plan checklist and progress
  - ui/notes_panel.rs: Notes editor (per-course/video), search, tagging, export
  - ui/theme_unified.rs: Theme context and switching logic
  - ui/navigation.rs: Routing and sidebar logic
  - ui/hooks.rs: Custom hooks for backend actions/state
  - dioxus-free-icons for all iconography.
  - dioxus-tailwindcss for utility styling and responsive design.
  - Scalability: Modular structure supports rapid feature addition and platform-specific overrides.

- [ ] Integrate dioxus-motion, dioxus-toast, and DaisyUI Feedback
  - Animate presence/layout for all major components and list items with dioxus-motion.
  - Toast notifications for feedback with dioxus-toast.
  - Use DaisyUI Modal/Dropdown for context menus and confirmations.
  - Scalability: Animation and feedback systems are reusable across new features.


## Phase 3: Backend Integration & State Management

- [ ] Connect UI to Backend via Async Actions/Hooks
  - All backend CRUD/search/export exposed as async actions/hooks using dioxus-sdk for state and effect management.
  - UI never touches DB directly—always via backend API.
  - Scalability: Backend API is decoupled from UI, enabling future migration to web/mobile or cloud sync.

- [ ] Elegant Error & Loading Handling
  - All mutations trigger toast notifications with dioxus-toast.
  - Error/loading states surfaced with DaisyUI skeletons, toasts, or inline feedback.
  - Scalability: Centralized error/loading handling simplifies maintenance and future enhancements.

- [ ] Prepare for Async DB (tokio)
  - Structure allows easy migration to async DB ops for responsiveness.
  - Scalability: Ready for high-concurrency or cloud-backed scenarios.


## Phase 4: Feature Mapping & UI Flows

- [ ] Courses
  - Dashboard grid (CourseCard), add/edit/delete, progress bar, export
  - Use dioxus-daisyui for cards, progress, and actions; dioxus-free-icons for visual cues.
  - Scalability: Course model supports metadata, tags, and future analytics.

- [ ] Planner
  - PlanView with checklist, progress, session controls
  - Use DaisyUI Accordion/Collapse for modules, checkboxes for progress.
  - Scalability: Planner logic is modular, supporting new scheduling strategies.

- [ ] Notes
  - Contextual panel with per-course and per-video notes, tagging, search, markdown editor, export
  - Use DaisyUI Tabs/Modal for editor, dioxus-motion for panel transitions, dioxus-toast for feedback.
  - Scalability: Notes backend supports tagging, advanced search, and future features (attachments, analytics).

- [ ] Ingest
  - Course import flows (YouTube, local), feedback via dioxus-toast
  - Scalability: Ingest system is modular, ready for new sources (Udemy, Coursera, etc.).


## Phase 5: Visual Polish & UX Enhancements

- [ ] Motion & Visual Effects
  - Animate all major transitions (presence, layout, hover/focus) with dioxus-motion.
  - Glassmorphism for sidebar and modals using DaisyUI and TailwindCSS utilities.
  - Glow for primary actions and active elements using DaisyUI accent colors.
  - Scalability: Visual system is theme-driven and easily extensible.

- [ ] Command Palette
  - Keyboard-driven modal for power users (Ctrl+K) using DaisyUI Modal and dioxus-free-icons for action icons.
  - Scalability: Command system can be extended with new actions as features grow.

- [ ] Data-Rich, Minimal UI
  - Use DaisyUI Dropdown/context menus and elegant visualizations (progress rings, etc.)
  - Scalability: UI shows complexity only when needed, keeping the experience clean as features expand.


## Phase 6: Testing, Accessibility, and Documentation

- [ ] Comprehensive Test Coverage
  - All backend and UI flows covered by unit and integration tests.
  - Use DaisyUI and Dioxus component test utilities where possible.
  - Scalability: Test suite grows with the codebase, ensuring reliability.

- [ ] Accessibility & Responsiveness
  - All UI components are keyboard-accessible and screen-reader friendly.
  - Responsive design for desktop, web, and mobile using dioxus-tailwindcss and DaisyUI.
  - Scalability: Accessibility is built-in, not bolted on.

- [ ] Documentation
  - Inline docs for all public APIs and UI flows.
  - Migration/upgrade notes for contributors.
  - Scalability: Good docs lower onboarding friction and support open-source/community growth.


## Backend Scalability Principles

- Modular, Pure Rust Core:
  - All business logic is platform-agnostic, enabling reuse across desktop, web, and mobile.

- Extensible Data Model:
  - Notes, courses, and planner are designed for easy extension (tags, attachments, analytics, etc.).

- Migration-Ready:
  - Schema migrations and upgrade paths are documented and tested.

- Async-Ready:
  - Backend can be migrated to async for high-concurrency or cloud scenarios.

- API-Driven:
  - All UI/backend interaction is via clear, documented APIs, supporting future REST/gRPC/websocket layers.
