```rust
// Multi-factor strategy selection
match (course_complexity, user_experience_level, module_count) {
    (complexity, _, _) if complexity > 0.8 => Adaptive,      // High complexity → AI scheduling
    (_, Beginner, _) => SpacedRepetition,                    // New learners → Memory optimization
    (_, _, modules) if well_structured => ModuleBased,       // Clear structure → Respect boundaries
    (_, _, _) if large_course => DifficultyBased,           // Big courses → Progressive difficulty
    _ => Hybrid,                                             // Default → Balanced approach
}

// Create a new course
course_manager.create_course.call("Advanced React Patterns".to_string());

// Update existing course
course_manager.update_course.call((course_id, "Updated Course Name".to_string()));

// Delete course with confirmation
course_manager.delete_course.call(course_id);

// Navigate to course plan view
course_manager.navigate_to_course.call(course_id);
